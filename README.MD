# HR Manager

Fork this project to get started.

## Introduction
This Application is used to manage the Employees of the company Monosis Ltd. <br/>
The HR Manager supports by default the following functions:
- Adding an Employee to the Database
- Editing the information of an Employee
- Deleting an Employee
- Listing all Employees

## Assignment
We prepared the very basic structure of the HR Manager.<br/>
Now we need you to complete the application.<br/>
We left some methods empty with the following remark: `//TODO: implement`. You need to implement them.<br/>
We also left some comments in already existing code like: `//TODO: add error handling`. Here you need to complete the method.
You will need to add some methods by your own.

## End of the Coding Challenge
It's not important if you can finish the challenge or not. We just want to see you coding skills and styles. So please commit all your changes even if you have errors or just some methods implemented.<br/>
In the end of the coding challenge please make sure you committed you code to [GitLab](https://gitlab.ubs.net/).<br/>
You can do this by executing the following command: `git add -A && git commit -m"implemented methodes of the coding challenge" && git push origin master`.<br/>
And be sure you shared your project with [Leon Krug](https://gitlab.net/leon.krug), [Emanuel Sedlacek](https://gitlab.net/emanuel.sedlacek) and [Enma Ronquillo](https://gitlab.net/enma.ronquillo).
